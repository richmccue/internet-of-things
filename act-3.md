# Make Your Own Weather Station

Adapted from [Adafruit IO: Basics - AnalogIn](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-io-basics-analog-input){:target="_blank"} by Todd Treece

In this tutorial, you will learn how to detect light with a sensor and relay that info to Adafruit IO. If you or your group have any questions, or get stuck as you work through this in-class exercise, please ask the instructor for assistance.  Have fun!

## List of Materials
1.  Adafruit Feather HUZZAH board, breadboard, USB cable
2.  Photoresistor or light sensor (below)
3.  3 jumper wires
4.  1 k-ohm resistor in order for this to work (brown - black - red - gold)

## Instructions

1.  Log into [io.adafruit.com](io.adafruit.com){:target="_blank"} (if you haven’t created an account yet, you can do that now). Along the left sidebar, click **Feeds** and then **Actions > Create a New Feed**. Name your feed “analog”

    ```
    Analog in this case refers to the type of input the computer receives -- that is, analog input rather than digital input. Analog input can give you a range of values (0‒1024     in Adafruit IO) whereas digital input can only give you 2 values (0 or 1)
    ```

2.  Go to Dashboards on the left sidebar and then click **Actions > Create a New Dashboard**. Name the new dashboard “Light Sensor”. Once created, the new dashboard will appear on the page. Click on the name of your new dashboard
3.  For now, the dashboard is blank
