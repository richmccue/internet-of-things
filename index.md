# Introduction to the Internet of Things with Adafruit Feather Huzzah

- Pre-workshop activities: 10 min 
- Introductory presentation: 10 min
- Hands-on activities: 80 min

## Why the Internet of Things 

The AdaFruit Feather Huzzah board allows you to quickly make a variety of Internet of Things (IoT) projects with little to no programming or electronics experience. The Feather Huzzah connected to sensors can communicate sensor data to cloud-based services (e.g. weather station temperature and humidity data) or receive data from the cloud or directly from you to turn on connected devices (e.g. Twitter re-tweets could trigger a LED light show in your office). The ESP8266 chip that is at the heart of the AdaFruit board is commonly found in IoT devices like:

- Hobby devices, including weather stations, and holiday light shows
- Security devices, including surveillance cameras and smart locks
- Energy devices, including HVACs and thermostats 
- Medical devices, including wearable health monitors

## Learning objectives

At the end of this workshop, you will be able to:

1. Be aware of a range of use cases for Adafruit Feather Huzzah IOT devices
2. Be able to configure a computer for Feather Huzzah development
3. Use web services like Adafruit IO and IFTTT to quickly web enable Feather Huzzah projects
4. Use a Feather Huzzah to send information to web services to perform an action on the web
5. Use web services to send information to a Feather Huzzah to perform a local action

## Things You Need for the Workshop
Your own laptop. This workshop involves programming a microcontroller that requires a USB driver to be installed with administrator access, which you will not have on a laptop borrowed from the library.
